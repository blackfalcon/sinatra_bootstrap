# Sinatra Bootstrap

A boilerplate Sinatra project to help you get up and running fast. 

## Contents Enclosed

Sinatra Bootstrap includes a few Heroku niceties like a Procfile, a config.ru file, and a handy `asset:precompile` Rake task for compiling your Sass/SCSS for production. (Heroku will perform that task as part of the standard deployment process. All you have to to do is `git push heroku`)

## Installation
